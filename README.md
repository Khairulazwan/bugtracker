# bugtracker
Hi, I am Khairulazwan, the person who developed this system. The system have 3 level of access which are Admin, Expertise, and User. 
The User role is when the person wants to report a bug/issue, the Admin role will identify the bug severity and assign the expertise to solve the bug. 
The bug ID is generated automatically based on year, month and running number. For example, BUG2210001. The number "22" is the year, "10" is the month, and "001" is the
running number. If it is new month than it will change to BUG2211001, if not, then it will go to BUG2210002.
Lastly, the Expertise role will solve the issue and update the progress in the system. The system will also identify the time taken for the expertise to solve the problem.
